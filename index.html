            <h3 id="black"><b><center>2. Interest in being a candidate for FrontEnd :</center></b></h3>
            <p>I am interested in Frontend Development because I enjoy designing and developing user interfaces that enhance user experience, even though I'm still a beginner with the whole coding to make an html website, etc. I'm also eager to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks involved when practicing these digital programming languages. By having Unit Tekno as my second priority, I hope to contribute to the development of engaging and responsive web applications while learning from experienced developers that manages the unit.</p>

            <p>Yes, I'd say that I have been involved in the design field before. With personal experiences from working with tools such as Figma or Canva to create UI/UX designs, posters, or other visual content, I enjoy designing applications and am interested in learning more about UI/UX principles, user flows, and wireframing. I believe that good design enhances user experience, and I would love to contribute my skills while improving them further.</p>
